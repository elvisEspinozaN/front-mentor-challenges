## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I focused on improving my workflow. I learned:

- How to **prioritize a mobile-first design approach**, starting with base styles and progressively enhancing them for larger screens.
- The importance of setting a **CSS base structure** before diving into specific styles, ensuring better scalability.
- A better understanding of how to use **media queries** for responsive designs.

Here’s an example of a simple, mobile-first media query I implemented:

```css
body {
  font-size: 15px;
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to focus on improving the following areas:

- CSS mastery: I want to get faster and more efficient when creating layouts, especially for responsive designs.
- CSS Grid and Flexbox: I aim to feel confident switching between the two for different use cases.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Mastery](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is a fantastic reference for understanding and using CSS Grid. It’s concise and provides real-world examples.
